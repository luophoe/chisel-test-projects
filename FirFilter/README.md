# FirFilter
- shows the sepcial porperty fo Chisel programming
- Fir filter that takes in coefficient to parameterize the number to register created with the use of Vector. According to the input coefficient, the number of inputs, register initialied, and the length of the for loop is changed. The result is that with a change to the coefficient, the generated Verilog code will be different.

- by making use of generators not instances, the example shows the special property of Chisel and how it is considered more efficient in these cases
